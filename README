jqcached is a jQuery plugin that makes DOM selector caching extremely easy.

Make your application perform better by querying the DOM once and using the selectors without any additional overhead of re-querying them ever again.

Why use it?
1. The DOM is slow, it is a bottleneck for each JavaScript application. Respect it - cache and reuse.
2. In case you change the name of element's class or ID, you have to change it only at one place instead of all over the code.
3. It creates convenient coding convention.
